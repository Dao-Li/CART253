Dao-Li Leboeuf (40097085)

Modification of a simple dodging game with keyboard controls.
The dodge game now display the number of successful dodges at the bottom.
Furthermore, the enemy's size and speed both also change if the player win.
They both are reset if the player loses. The enemy is displayed as a lion and
the player is a little cat in a jungle atmosphere. If the player pressed the
space bar, the style change between normal style and retro style.
